**Association Rule Based Recommender System**

**Business Problem**

Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service.

It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, renovation, transportation with a few touches on your computer or smartphone.

It is intended to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning using the data set that includes service users and the services and categories these users receive.
